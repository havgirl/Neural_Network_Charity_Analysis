# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Objective

The purpose of this challenge is to utilize our knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, using features in the provided dataset to assist our client in creating a binary classifer that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

This will be accomplised by completing three technical analysis components and a written report.  The technical analysis includes:
- Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
- Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
- Optimize the Model

## Results 

### Data Preprocessing

![](Resources/Target_Feature_Column.png)

The client requested we answer the following questions:

Q1. What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?

*A1. The IS_SUCCESSFUL column indicates that a charity has been successfully funded by AlphabetSoup, thereby this column will be considered a target for the model.*

Q2. What variable(s) are considered to be the features for our model?

*A2. The IS_SUCCESSFUL column will also be the feature chosen for this dataset.*

Q3. What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

*A3. The EIN and NAME columns are neither targets nor features for this dataset and were removed from the input data.*

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
